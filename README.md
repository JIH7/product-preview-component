## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I went into this project with one major goal, use the Figma design to make as much of a perfect 1:1 layout as possible. Most of what I learned on this project had to do with getting familiar with Figma, learning how to measure padding and margins, and learning the layout to find things such as text styles
